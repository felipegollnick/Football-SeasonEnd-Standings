# Football Season End Standings
This dataset contains the final season standings for some of the most important football leagues around the world.

As of **31/07/2023**, data was restricted to the first division of national leagues that were disputed by 20 teams (with 38 games played by each team), from 2002/03 season until 2022/23. 
This might be expanded in the near future.

Information was extracted from [this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/english-premier-league-standings) (Premier League) and [OGOL.com.br](https://ogol.com.br/) (other leagues).

**Check out my first notebook on this dataset**, where I explore the data to find the consequences of the [2006 Calciopoli Scandal in Italy](https://github.com/felipegollnick/Football-SeasonEnd-Standings/blob/main/Calciopoli_Analysis.ipynb).
